The concept for the midterm project:

My topic is the simulated world. I want to create a water surface which can be interact with. When mouseclicked, a ripple and a random fish will be generated on the position of the mouse. There are two different types of fish. When the bigger fish encounter with the smaller fish, it will trigger a new ripper also the bigger fish will open its mouth and change color. I am trying to add more fish with different characteristics.
